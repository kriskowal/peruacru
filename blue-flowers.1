There were once a brother and sister who would shrink
themselves with a blue potion and explore the world from
the back of a paper airplane. They discovered an
uninhabited island amid the sparkling Pacific ocean and
named it PerÃºacru. They alighted upon a grassy knoll and
drank their red growing potions, only to damage their plane
and lose their stock of potions. The clever pair set out to
explore the island and hopefully find a way home. ---
